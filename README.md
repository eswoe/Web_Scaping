# Web_Scaping
README
The Web_Scraping_Assignment file is a combination of web scraping done on the Bob Dylan website and then visualizing that data in various charts in a Jupyter notebook.
The Web_Scraping_AZ_Lyrics file displays how I followed Melanie Walsh's tutorial to scape data off the AZ Lyrics website. I couldn't quite work out how to get the data to fit into a dataframe and then use that to create visualizations, which is why I did the visualizations witht the Bob Dylan scraped data.
Both files consititute as my submission for the Week 4 assignment.
